# Pomodoro Stopwatch
### Built with Python and PySide6

Pomodoro Stopwatch is a focus timer that adapts to how long you can actually concentrate, instead of forcing fixed time blocks.
It follows the core ideas of the Pomodoro Method while dynamically adjusting work sessions based on your behavior.

## How It’s Different From Traditional Pomodoro

Traditional Pomodoro uses fixed intervals (25 / 5 minutes).
Pomodoro Stopwatch adapts by letting you work until focus naturally drops.
This results in sessions that feel more natural and sustainable.
