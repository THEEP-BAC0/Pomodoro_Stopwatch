Notes:
 - Start a stopwatch when you begin working, and keep going until you naturally lose focus — whether you check your phone, get distracted, or switch tasks. When that happens, stop the stopwatch.
 - Whatever number you see is your baseline focus time — the amount of time your brain can focus right now without force.
 - Take a break that matches the effort you just spent: shorter baseline means a short break (1–3 minutes), and longer baseline means a slightly longer break (5–10 minutes).
 - Set a countdown timer for the length of your baseline focus time.
 - Repeat the process until you're done.
 - Your baseline resets each day, so begin fresh every time you start work.
 - Optionally, record your session times to see patterns in your focus and improve over time.
